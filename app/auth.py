    Retrieve the expected API key from environment variable at runtime.
    
    This allows us to change the API key without redeploying the application, 
    which is important for security best practices (e.g. rotating keys regularly).
    
    Why environment variable and not a hardcoded string? 
    Because hardcoding secrets end up in git history, Docker images, and 
    log files. Environment variables are injected at runtime and never touch the codebase, 
    making them much safer for managing secrets like API Keys.

    In development: set it in your Shell
    $env:SCANNER_API_KEY = "your-dev-secret-key" # PowerShell
    export SCANNER_API_KEY="your-dev-secret-key" # Bash/Linux/Mac

    In production: set it in your hosting environment's secret manager or 
    environment variable configuration (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager, Heroku Config Vars, etc.)
    Inject via Docker, Kubernetes secrets, or cloud secret manager - code never changes, 
    just the environment variable value.
