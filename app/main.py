    ## Avron

    Scans web applications and APIs for security vulnerabilities using the
    [Nuclei](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/) engine.

    ### Authentication
    Scan endpoints require an API key. Include a valid key in the `X-API-KEY` header.
    Health and metrics endpoints do not require a key.

    ### Workflow
    1. Submit a target URL via 'POST /scan' to initiate a scan - receive a unique `scan_id` immediately.
    2. Poll 'GET /scan/{scan_id}' until "status" changes from "in_progress" to "completed" or "failed", then retrieve results.
    3. Results include any vulnerabilities found, along with metadata about the scan/findings.

    ### Rate Limiting
    To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, the API implements rate limiting:
    - `POST /scan`: Limited to 10 requests per minute per IP address.
    - `GET /scan/{scan_id}`: Limited to 20 requests per minute per IP address.

    Clients that exceed these limits will receive a 429 Too Many Requests response, 
    indicating that they have made too many requests in a given amount of time and should slow down.

    ### Security Considerations
    - API keys should be kept secret and secure. Do not hardcode them in source code or expose them in client-side applications.
    - The API should be accessed over HTTPS to protect API keys and data in transit.

    GET requests are much less resource intensive than starting a new scan, so we can allow a higher rate limit for status checks.

    Clients need to check scan status more frequently than they start scans, especially for longer-running scans,
