# with a variety of valid URLs to ensure that it accepts them without raising a ValidationError.

# was silently accepted, exactly the security hole we're testing against.

# We also assert the error MESSAGE is useful. A ValidationError with no
# actionable message is nearly as bad as no validation at all — it tells
# the API consumer nothing about how to fix their request.
