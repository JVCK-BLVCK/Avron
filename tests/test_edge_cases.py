# ___Unicode and Special Characters___
# 
# Test that the application can handle Unicode characters in file names and scan results.
# Real targets include internationalized domain names (IDNs), Unicode paths, and special caharacters
# in query strings/payloads.
# This test ensures that the application can process and store scan results
# containing Unicode characters without errors or data corruption.
# Why this matters for security testing: Attackers may use Unicode characters to obfuscate malicious payloads or
# to target specific internationalized domains. Ensuring that the application can handle these characters
# is crucial for accurate scanning and reporting.
# If the application fails to handle Unicode characters properly, 
# it may lead to incorrect scan results, missed vulnerabilities, or even application crashes.
